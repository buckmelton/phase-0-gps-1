**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session? What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
I was struggling with the concept of how to use Github in the "real world"- how to collaborate and who merges the branch. This was cleared up for me.  I also wasn't sure how to merge a feature branch with a master branch in the terminal (rather than on Github), so I was glad I got some practice using that.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
- I asked my pair how he would word what some of the terminal commands do (pwd, ls, etc.)
- I asked his opinion about the best approach for some terminal commands like merge.
- I asked follow up questions to the guide about how to use Github in a collaboration.

**What still confuses you about git?**
One thing we need to research further is the definition of git fetch and git merge and why you would use it instead of git pull.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
I enjoyed it! I thought it was nice to have someone chiming in and correcting us when we were going down the wrong path.
