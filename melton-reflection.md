# Reflection for GPS 1.1 - Version Control and Git

1. What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

  I had most of the git concepts well-practiced prior to the GPS session.  The one feature I wasn't clear on was collaborating and dealing with merge conflicts.

2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

  During the GPS my pair and I were able to work through a merge conflict, which made it all clear to me.

3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

  I asked the guide about how to avoid having to enter my GitHub username and password each time I did a push.  I had no particular questions for my pair.

4. What still confuses you about git?

  When you do a git push and a git pull, you specify 'origin', which refers to my remote repository.  Under what circumstances would you specify something other than 'origin' and what would you specify?

5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

  Um, it was OK.  The woman I paired with was an excellent pair.  Although I'm a pretty outgoing guy and good in social situations, I feel socially awkward and tense in one-on-one situations with people who aren't friends or family, all the more so if I've just met the person.  I find it very draining and uncomfortable in general.  Given that context, the pairing went extremely well.  It was comforting to have the guide there.
